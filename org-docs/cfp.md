Hello!
Let me introduce myself, I’m a co-leader of Belarus JUG: Java Professionals BY.
{<Something personal> or <We met at conference...>}

We organize the local community around Java and IT. Our community is a place of integration and socialization of students and IT professionals. Promote engineering culture by improving the quality of knowledge in different areas.
We conduct regular meetups for several years, more than 120 professionals attend our events.
And help to organize local Java conferences as well: JavaDay https://javaday.by/ and JET Conference https://twitter.com/jetconf.

Currently we're looking for great speakers!
If you can advise someone, who can make a talk – it will be great.
Modern Java, frameworks, work experience – everything that excites the speaker his/herself is welcome!
Our group guarantees reimbursement of flight and hotel room for speakers from Europe.

You can find some information about us (though it's in Russian) here:
